# Agentic RAG Workflow Engine - Project Overview

## Introduction

The Agentic RAG Workflow Engine is a sophisticated multi-agent system designed to revolutionize document retrieval and question answering. Unlike traditional RAG systems that follow a linear retrieve-then-generate approach, our system employs intelligent agents that collaborate to understand queries, strategically retrieve information, and synthesize comprehensive answers.

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **Query Analyzer Agent**: Breaks down complex queries and identifies key entities
- **Retrieval Agent**: Performs intelligent document retrieval based on analysis
- **Synthesis Agent**: Generates coherent, source-cited answers

### Advanced Document Processing
- Support for multiple document formats (PDF, Markdown, Text)
- Semantic chunking that preserves document structure
- Intelligent page tracking for accurate citations

### Configurable Components
- Modular design allowing easy swapping of LLMs, embedding models, and vector databases
- OpenAI GPT-4o for generation and text-embedding-3-large for embeddings
- ChromaDB for persistent vector storage

### Source Citation
- All generated answers include proper source citations
- Page-level references for PDF documents
- Confidence scoring for answer quality assessment

## Architecture Components

### Core Workflow Orchestrator
The orchestrator manages the entire multi-agent workflow:
1. Query analysis and entity extraction
2. Strategic document retrieval
3. Context preparation and formatting
4. Answer synthesis with citations

### Vector Database Integration
- ChromaDB for local vector storage
- Automatic embedding generation using OpenAI
- Similarity search with configurable thresholds

### Document Ingestion Pipeline
- Batch processing of document directories
- Metadata extraction and content hashing
- Semantic chunking for optimal retrieval

## Performance Metrics

The system is designed to meet specific performance targets:
- Query processing time: 5-10 seconds for moderate knowledge bases
- High retrieval precision through intelligent ranking
- Source faithfulness with verifiable citations
- Scalable architecture supporting 1000+ documents

## Use Cases

### Enterprise Knowledge Management
Perfect for organizations needing to query large document repositories with high accuracy and proper attribution.

### Research and Development
Ideal for researchers who need to quickly find and cite relevant information from extensive literature collections.

### Customer Support
Enables support teams to provide accurate, well-sourced answers to customer inquiries.

## Technical Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API access
