## What is the Agentic RAG Workflow Engine?

The Agentic RAG Workflow Engine is a sophisticated multi-agent system that goes beyond traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches. Instead of following a simple retrieve-then-generate pattern, our system uses specialized AI agents that collaborate to:

1. **Analyze queries** intelligently to understand intent and extract key entities
2. **Retrieve documents** strategically based on the analysis
3. **Synthesize answers** that are comprehensive, accurate, and properly cited

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for different workflow stages
- **Intelligent Query Processing**: Complex query breakdown and entity extraction
- **Semantic Document Chunking**: Preserves document structure and context
- **Source Citation**: All answers include proper attribution to source documents
- **Modular Design**: Easy to swap LLMs, embedding models, and vector databases
- **Command-Line Interface**: Simple CLI for document management and querying

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API access for embeddings and generation
- Sufficient storage for document vector database
- Internet connection for API calls

## Supported Document Types

- PDF files (`.pdf`)
- Markdown files (`.md`)
- Plain text files (`.txt`)
