# Multi-Agent Workflow

The Agentic RAG Workflow Engine employs a sophisticated multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to process queries and generate comprehensive answers. This document details how the agents work together.

## Workflow Overview

```
User Query → Query Analyzer → Retriever → Synthesizer → Final Answer
     ↓              ↓             ↓           ↓            ↓
   Analysis    Entity Extract   Document   Context    Cited Response
   & Planning    & Strategy     Retrieval   Assembly   & Confidence
```

## Agent Collaboration Model

### Sequential Processing
Each agent builds upon the previous agent's output:
1. **Query Analyzer** provides structured analysis
2. **Retriever** uses analysis for strategic document retrieval
3. **Synthesizer** combines retrieved context into coherent answers

### Information Flow
```
Query Analysis → Retrieval Strategy → Document Context → Answer Generation
```

## Agent Specifications

### 1. Query Analyzer Agent

**Purpose**: Transform natural language queries into structured analysis for optimal retrieval.

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Entity Extraction**: Identifies key people, places, concepts, and technical terms
- **Intent Classification**: Determines what the user is trying to accomplish
- **Complexity Assessment**: Scores query complexity from 1-5
- **Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex queries into manageable sub-questions
- **Search Optimization**: Generates optimized terms for vector similarity search

**Analysis Process:**
1. Parse natural language query
2. Extract named entities and key concepts
3. Assess query complexity and type
4. Generate search strategies
5. Output structured analysis

**Example Analysis:**
```json
{
  "query_type": "complex",
  "main_topic": "neural network architecture comparison",
  "key_entities": ["neural networks", "CNN", "RNN", "transformer"],
  "sub_questions": [
    "What are the different neural network types?",
    "How do CNN and RNN architectures differ?",
    "What are the advantages of each approach?"
  ],
  "search_terms": ["neural", "network", "architecture", "CNN", "RNN"],
  "intent": "comparative_analysis",
  "complexity_score": 4,
  "retrieval_strategy": "multi_query_with_entity_boosting"
}
```

### 2. Retriever Agent

**Purpose**: Intelligently retrieve relevant document chunks based on query analysis.

**Retrieval Strategies:**

**Multi-Query Approach:**
- Generates multiple search queries from analysis
- Performs parallel similarity searches
- Combines and deduplicates results

**Intelligent Ranking:**
- Base similarity scores from vector search
- Entity presence boosting
- Topic relevance scoring
- Recency and source quality factors

**Filtering and Selection:**
- Similarity threshold enforcement
- Duplicate removal
- Result limitation and optimization

**Retrieval Process:**
1. Generate search queries from analysis
2. Execute vector similarity searches
3. Apply intelligent ranking algorithms
4. Filter and deduplicate results
5. Format context for synthesis

**Example Retrieval Output:**
```
Retrieved Documents: 5 chunks
- document1.pdf (Page 12): Similarity 0.92
- document2.md: Similarity 0.89
- document3.pdf (Page 5): Similarity 0.85
- document1.pdf (Page 15): Similarity 0.83
- document4.txt: Similarity 0.81
```

### 3. Synthesizer Agent

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive, well-cited answers from retrieved document context.

**Synthesis Capabilities:**
- **Context Integration**: Combines multiple sources coherently
- **Source Attribution**: Proper citation with [Source X] format
- **Factual Grounding**: Ensures claims are supported by provided context
- **Answer Structuring**: Logical organization of complex responses
- **Confidence Assessment**: Estimates answer reliability

**Synthesis Process:**
1. Analyze retrieved document context
2. Structure response based on query complexity
3. Integrate information from multiple sources
4. Add proper source citations
5. Assess confidence and quality

**Quality Assurance:**
- Verifies all claims are source-supported
- Ensures proper citation format
- Checks answer completeness
- Estimates confidence scores
